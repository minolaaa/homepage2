        <td>Creating my DBQ draft was extremely hard. I got extreme writers block every time I started typing and I couldn't seem to buckle down and finish my draft. I constantly procrastinated creating my draft until the very last minute. Although the process of creating my DBQ paper was difficult for me, I'm very proud of my paper. I feel like in the end I was able to retain a lot of information about the Enlightenment Revolutions.</td>
